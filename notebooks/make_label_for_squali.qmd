# Making A Label For _Squalicorax Pristodontus_

_The following tutorial demonstrates how to use Paleo Utils to make a label for a specimen from the Late Cretaceous of New Jersey that the author found._

NOTES: Two labels come to mind, i.e. collections and systematics labels (both are classes, subclassed as Labels). Systematics labels have Linnaen taxonomic considerations. Collections labels have elements such as Collector, Repository, Date Found, Locale, etc... Each Label has dimensions, font, a save path, and a font size. Each Label can be saved as an image, as SVG, as text, or as a PDF.
